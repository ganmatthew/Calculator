Note the order of operations
L-R	1) parenthesis expressions ()
R-L	2) logical operator NOT (!)
L-R	3) exponentiation (^)
L-R	4) multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%)
L-R	5) addition (+) and subtraction (-)
L-R	6) relational operators (>) (>=) (<=) and (<)
L-R	7) relational operators (==) and (!=)
L-R	8) logical operators AND (&&) and OR (||)
